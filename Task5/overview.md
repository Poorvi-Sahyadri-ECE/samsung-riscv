## **Overview**  
This project creates an SOS Morse Code signal using an LED and a VSDSquadron Mini (CH32V003) microcontroller. The LED blinks in the standard Morse Code pattern (· · · — — — · · ·), which is widely recognized as a distress signal.

The microcontroller controls the LED by turning it ON and OFF at precise intervals to match the Morse Code sequence. This project demonstrates basic microcontroller programming, GPIO control, and timing functions.

Use Case:

Emergency signaling
Learning Morse Code
Understanding microcontroller-based LED control
