## **Overview**  

This project creates an **SOS Morse Code signal** using an **LED** and a **VSDSquadron Mini (CH32V003)** microcontroller. The LED blinks in the standard **Morse Code pattern** (`· · · — — — · · ·`), which is widely recognized as a distress signal.  

The microcontroller controls the LED by turning it **ON and OFF at precise intervals** to match the Morse Code sequence. This project demonstrates **basic microcontroller programming, GPIO control, and timing functions**.  

🔹 **Use Case:**  
- Emergency signaling  
- Learning Morse Code  
- Understanding microcontroller-based LED control
